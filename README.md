# Hog Game Simulator and Strategies

Introduction

Welcome to the Hog Game Simulator and Strategies repository! In this project, you will develop a simulator and multiple strategies for the dice game Hog, applying control and higher-order functions. The project involves implementing various game rules and strategies to create an engaging and challenging experience.

Game Overview

Hog is a two-player game where players alternate turns to reach 100 points first. On each turn, the current player chooses a number of dice to roll (up to 10), and their turn score is the sum of the dice outcomes. The game includes special rules such as Free bacon, Hog wild, and Swine swap, which add strategic elements and excitement to the gameplay.
